# OT IT Convergence Kill Chain

The OT IT Convergence Kill Chain is a conceptual framework that describes how enterprise level compromise can evolve into operational and physical risk in converged IT, cloud, and operational technology environments.

The framework models progression, not attacks.

It is designed to help security leaders, risk owners, and operational decision makers reason about how risk accumulates over time through legitimate access, organizational structure, and trust relationships that were never designed to withstand adversarial pressure.

## Why This Framework Exists

Incidents impacting critical infrastructure are often labeled as OT failures. In practice, they rarely begin in operational systems.

Modern enterprises operate highly interconnected environments where IT, cloud, vendors, and OT are linked through identities, remote access, shared tooling, and operational workflows. These connections enable efficiency and scale. They also allow risk to progress quietly across domains.

Existing cybersecurity and industrial security standards provide essential foundations for governance, protection, and response. However, they are not designed to explicitly model how compromise progresses across converged environments over time, particularly when that progression relies on legitimate access rather than technical exploitation.

This framework exists to address that gap.

## What the OT IT Convergence Kill Chain Models

The framework describes a progression through seven phases:

1. Enterprise Exposure Accumulation  
2. Initial Trust Breach  
3. Identity and Access Drift  
4. OT Adjacent Visibility and Mapping  
5. Convergence Pivot  
6. Operational Influence Establishment  
7. Physical Process Impact  

Each phase represents a condition in which risk increases due to systemic and organizational factors. Earlier phases persist as later phases emerge.

The model focuses on failure modes, signals, control intent, and decision thresholds rather than tools, exploits, or threat actor behavior.

## Intended Use

The OT IT Convergence Kill Chain is intended to be used as:

- A lens for understanding how enterprise compromise becomes operational risk  
- A common language between IT, OT, security, and leadership  
- A framework for identifying early intervention points  
- A foundation for executive decision making under uncertainty  
- A complement to existing cybersecurity and industrial security standards  

It is not a detection system, playbook, or implementation guide.

---

## What This Framework Is Not

This framework does not provide:

- Tactical guidance for attacking or defending systems  
- Tool specific or vendor aligned recommendations  
- Threat actor profiling or attribution  
- Compliance checklists or control catalogs  
- Step by step implementation instructions  

It is intentionally abstract to ensure longevity, regulatory safety, and cross sector applicability.

---

## Relationship to Existing Standards

The OT IT Convergence Kill Chain is designed to complement widely adopted standards such as:

- NIST Cybersecurity Framework  
- ISA IEC 62443  
- NIST SP 800 82  
- MITRE ATT and CK for ICS  

It provides a progression based lens that can be layered on top of existing programs to enhance early risk recognition and decision alignment.

## Status

This repository contains version 0.1 of the framework.

The framework is expected to evolve based on research, operational experience, and peer review. Future iterations may expand definitions, mappings, and supporting materials.
